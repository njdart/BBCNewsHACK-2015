#Location centred.


##TYPICAL IDEAS.						
 - Plain news
 - linking to facebook/other social media.
 
##OUR IDEAS.
 - The target market for our app will typically be students, but due to how the app is personalised to each individual it will be easily adaptable to anyone.
 - The user can select which Towns or Cities they would like to receive news alerts from, which is especially useful for students who live away from home but want to stay informed of current events.
 - We will have the option on the app for users to make the device location aware, making it suitable for people on holiday. For example tripadvisor.
'This day in history'- interesting fact, through this we could work with the local museum and thus aid in boosting their custom. Saying we're interested in helping local businesses is a big win. 
 - Many of these ideas already focus on how to make the app centred on the individual but we can link to reddit and places.
 - We can say how we will use the BBC to promote our local news services, including Cambrian News, local radio stations and independent blogs from local people.


We can try and gets quotes from the Cambrian newspaper and radio stations, these names will add greater weight to the app and show we're not full of crap and have looked into the possibility of these things.
